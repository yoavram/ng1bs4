# ng1bs4
## A Library of AngularJS Components Implementing Boostrap 4
### _Tomorrow's Library with Yesterday's Framework_

Just because you use AngularJS and not Angular like all
the cool kids, does'nt mean you can't look good!

Enjoy the robust styling architecture of the new [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/),
while still using good ol' [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

See it in action at https://idanco.github.io/ng1bs4/.

## Alternatives

* Still used to Bootstrap 3.x? Use [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
* Finally upgraded to Angular? Use [NG Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)
* None of the above? You belong with us!

## Install

Install _ng1bs4_

```sh
npm install ng1bs4 --save
```

Import `ng1bs4` module and styling into your project

```js
import ng1bs4 from 'ng1bs4';
import 'ng1bs4/dist/import.css'
```

Inject `ng1bs4` module into your app

```js
angular
  .module('myApp', [
    ...,
    ng1bs4
  ]);
```

Test by adding this directive anywhere in your markup

```html
<ngbs-test></ngbs-test>
```

## Philosophy

**No Styling**. We believe you should be able to customize as much as you want, and with Bootstrap 4 theming is easy! That's why all components include minimal styling and rely heavily on Bootstrap's native classes and variables.

**Simple Code**. We strive to keep all components as simple yet robust as possible. Hence, rewiring them to fit your needs should be easy peasy.
